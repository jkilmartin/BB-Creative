# BubbleBox Creative

Hello! We are four [YooBee School of Design](https://www.yoobee.ac.nz/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm4a1oNvV4QIVQg4rCh1bNA3hEAAYASAAEgJN__D_BwE) students each working on an individual web application to run as part of this group project.

This assignment constitutes part of our course at [YooBee](https://www.yoobee.ac.nz/); as such it is purely for educational purposes, but if you are interested then please [get involved](https://github.com/sargimo/Assignment-3-take-2/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Tech
The project is built using the [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) framework, the [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) library, and APIs specific to each group member's use case. [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) is used with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for task running, and [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) is used to handle dependencies. We use [vue-resource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-resource) for requests and responses and [vue-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router) to handle page routing. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used for some styling and interactions.

If you are planning to contribute, please follow best practices and the conventions outlined in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/sargimo/Assignment-3-take-2/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).
